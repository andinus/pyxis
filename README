═══════════════

  Pyxis can only follow feeds currently. I'm writing this for fun, more
  features will be added if I use it.

  The feeds are saved in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/pyxis', if it's not defined
  then `$HOME/.local/share/pyxis' is used. Feeds are configured in
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pyxis.pl' or `$HOME/.config/pyxis.pl'.


1.1 Commands
────────────

1.1.1 fetch
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  fetch will fetch all the latest feeds.


1.1.2 timeline
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  timeline will print your timeline from all the feeds. You can also
  pass an optional argument to load a single feed.

  For example, `pyxis timeline user' will load the feed `user'. You can
  pass multiple feeds like `pyxis timeline f1 f2', it'll load both `f1'
  & `f2'.


1.2 Configuration
─────────────────

  There is an example config file under `share/config.pl', move it
  config directory & rename it to `pyxis.pl'.

  *Warning*: Pyxis will evaluate the configuration file, which means an
  attacker can use it to run malicious code.

  *Note*: They could always add malicious code to `.profile' & do harm.
  Just thought I should put the warning.

  ┌────
  │ #!/usr/bin/perl
  │
  │ use strict;
  │ use warnings;
  │
  │ my %feeds = (
  │     example => "https://example.com/twtxt.txt",
  │ );
  │
  │ sub get_feeds { return %feeds; }
  │
  │ 1;
  └────

  Add your feeds to `%feeds' hash like shown above. You can remove those
  2 `use' lines but it's good if you keep them.
